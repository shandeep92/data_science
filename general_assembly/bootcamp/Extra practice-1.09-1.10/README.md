## Learning Objectives

<!--- This section lists the learning objectives of the lesson. For information on how to write clear learning objectives, see: http://ii.library.jhu.edu/2016/07/20/writing-effective-learning-objectives/ --->

*After this lessons, students will be able to:*

- Describe and calculate confidence intervals for the mean.
- Interpret the meaning of the confidence interval.
- Define the null and alternative hypotheses.
- Perform a two-sample t-test.
- Define the t-statistics and p-value.
- List the steps of hypothesis testing.
