    "### Hyperparameters of Decision Trees\n",
    "There are four hyperparameters of decision trees that we may commonly tune in order to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_depth`: The maximum depth of the tree.\n",
    "    - By default, the nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure (or some other argument limits the growth of the tree).\n",
    "    - In the 20 questions analogy, this is like \"How many questions we can ask?\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- `min_samples_split`: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\n",
    "    - By default, the minimum number of samples required to split is 2. That is, if there are two or more observations in a node and if we haven't already achieved maximum purity, we can split it!\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- `min_samples_leaf`: The minimum number of samples required to be in a leaf node (a terminal node at the end of the tree).\n",
    "    - By default, the minimum number of samples required in a leaf node is 1. (This should ring alarm bells - it's very possible that we'll overfit our model to the data!)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ccp_alpha`: A [complexity parameter](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html#minimal-cost-complexity-pruning) similar to $\\alpha$ in regularization. As `ccp_alpha` increases, we regularize more.\n",
    "    - By default, this value is 0.\n",

However, this is complicated and not easy for non-technical audiences. Decision trees are interpretable; it is easy to explain to show a picture of a decision tree to a client or boss and get them to understand how predictions are made.\n",
