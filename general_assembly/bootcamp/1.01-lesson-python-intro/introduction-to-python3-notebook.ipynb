    "Python is an extremely readable and versatile programming language. Written in a relatively straight-forward style with immediate feedback on errors. Python offers simplicity and versatility, in terms of extensibility and supported paradigms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many scripting and programming languages do not recognize the end of a line of code until it sees the termination character (in these cases, the semicolon). Thus, the actual physical lines of type taken up by the code are irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other languages, Python does **not** use an end of line character. Most of the time a simple <kbd>Enter</kbd> will do. Yet, Python is _very_ particular about indentation, spaces and lines in certain cases.\n",

    "It is important to understand how Python interprets:\n",
